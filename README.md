# Day 74 Task | Cohort 2.0

This repository contains the work completed as part of **Day 74** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
The focus of this task was to build a **Contact Management application using React**, with emphasis on form handling, state management, and structured component-based design.


## 🖼️ Project Overview

The application provides a simple interface where users can:
- Enter contact details using a form
- View submitted contacts displayed as cards in real time

The layout follows a **side-by-side structure**, improving clarity and usability.
